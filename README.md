### Open Source Contribution

- **traDSSAT** [[**Repo**](https://github.com/julienmalard/traDSSAT)]

  An awesome [DSSAT](https://dssat.net/) file management tool. I fixed a bug and increased it a little bit [[#20](https://github.com/julienmalard/traDSSAT/pull/20)] [[#21](https://github.com/julienmalard/traDSSAT/pull/21)] [[#22](https://github.com/julienmalard/traDSSAT/pull/22)] [[#23](https://github.com/julienmalard/traDSSAT/pull/23)].

### Projects

- **SoilWaterBalance** [**[Backend](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/SoilWaterBalance)**] [**[FrontendWeb](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/SoilWaterBalanceFrontend)**] [**[Mobile](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/SoilWaterBalanceMobile)**]

  I'm developing an app to easily get data from INMET API and use them for soil water balance analysis.

- **GoBarber** [**[Backend](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/GoBarberBackend)**] [**[FrontendWeb](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/GoBarberFrontend)**] [**[Mobile](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/GoBarberMobile)**]

  An app developed along the GoStack bootcamp. It allows users to schedule barber service and barbers to have their agenda at hand

- **CassavaPy** [**[Repo](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/CassavaPy)**] [[**Docs**](https://cassavapy.readthedocs.io/)] [[**PyPi**](https://pypi.org/project/CassavaPy/)]

  [DSSAT](https://dssat.net/) experimental files creation are boring and prone to errors. This project automates the process (a lot). Also, we can run simulations from command line and extract outputs easily (it use [traDSSAT](https://github.com/julienmalard/traDSSAT)).

- **ShinyApp** [[**Repo**](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/ShinyApp)] [[**Live**](https://cassava.shinyapps.io/cassavapainel/)]

  Well, mechanistic models yields a lot of information. In order to know what's going on you need to visualize at least two or three variables. So, I made a dashboard to not only easy that process but also share results with my team.
  
- **weatherData** [[**Repo**](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/weatherData)]

  Merge climate data from different sources is boring, tough and prone to errors. I made it for my work and left here some automatic procedures which can be useful. 
 
- **FilesDSSAT** [[**Repo**](https://github.com/FabioSeixas/FilesDSSAT)]

  An OOP exercise to translate data from one format to another. Of course, It is also related to DSSAT and boring tasks.
